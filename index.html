                    <h2>My life and skateboarding</h2>
                    <p>In the late 80s I started skateboarding as a kid. I remember my first skateboard that both my brother and I received from our parents. Mine had a pair of handlebars that screwed into the top of the trucks, it was a "Back to the Future" styled board, as I was about 5 and my brothers was one of those oldschool wide boards with one tail. </p>
