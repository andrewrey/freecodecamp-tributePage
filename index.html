                    <h2>My life and skateboarding</h2>
                    <p>In the late 80s I started skateboarding as a kid. I remember my first skateboard that both my brother and I received from our parents. Mine had a pair of handlebars that screwed into the top of the trucks, it was a "Back to the Future" styled board, as I was about 5 and my brothers was one of those oldschool wide boards with one tail. </p>
                    <p>As I got closer to my teens I started to take skateboarding more seriously. It was a lifestyle to me. I don't think I owned a pair of jeans for over 8 years as I remmber thinking that skateboarders only whoe Khaki styles pants or cargos.</p>

                    <h2>Muska: The Rockstar Skater</h2>
                    <p>There were many great skaters which I followed, however the one skater that I especially thought was great was Chad Muska. He was great at skateboarding and had an awesome style. I felt he brought a kind of hiphop culture into skateboarding.</p>
                    <p>I was also really into beat making and underground hiphop at the time and I loved to listening to music and skateboarding. Music was a way to just go with the flow and skate.</p>
